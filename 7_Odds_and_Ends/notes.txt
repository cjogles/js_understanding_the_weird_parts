Odds and Ends

Initialization:
    - Don't be intimidated by prototyping data with 
      large collections of data. 

typeof() instanceof() and figuring out what something is:
    - Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) for arrays
    - typeof null is a bug since forever. 

strictmode:
    - "use strict"; can go top of file or function 
      to make it a rule to define variables.
