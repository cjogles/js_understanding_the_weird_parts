Objects and Functions
    - in JS objects and functions are VERY related. 
    - objects can have properties and methods attached 
      to them. properties include primitives like bools 
      strings, or numbers/variables. or other objects. 
      methods include functions. 

Objects and the dot operator:
    - you can use the dot operator to 
      traverse objects or you could use 
      the COMPUTED MEMBER ACCESS OPERATOR 
      just means the [] to do the same thing.

Objects and Object Literals:
    - often there is more then one way to do something.
    - you can use {} to do "new Object();" 
    - that's called an object literal. 

Framework Aside:
    - Faking Namespaces
    - Namespace is a container for variables and functions. 
    - typically used to keep variables and functions 
      with the same name separate. 
    - JS since it uses objects under the hood we can 
      fake namespaces. 
    - You will need to create all the layers in the object
      first before you add values or else you'll get 
      undefined error.
