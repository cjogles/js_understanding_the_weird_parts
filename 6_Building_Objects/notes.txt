Building Objects

    - see examples in app.js

Function constructor:
    - just means its a function that is used to construct 
      a new object. The "this" variable points to the new
      object and is automatically returned. Use the new keyword
      to do this. 

How do we set up the protoype? 
    - when we use the constructor it automatically 
      sets up the prototype for you. But remember 
      this confusing fact, the prototype of the function
      is not the prototype of the object!__proto__ is the 
      object prototype. every function in JS gets 
      a prototype that is different. 

Dangerous aside with the new keyword:
    - just make sure to use the new keyword and 
      remember it by using capitalized names 
      for the function constructor.
