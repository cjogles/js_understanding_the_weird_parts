Getting Started - Goals of this course

Philosophy:
    - Don't imitate. Understand.

Setup Needs:
    - Internet Browser with dev tools 
      (I'll use chrome)
    - Text editor (i'll us VS Code)

Big Words and JS:
    - JS has a tendency to use words that 
      seem bigger and more
      complex then they really are. To combat this,
      We will do "Big Word Alerts" to talk about 
      their definitions and how they are used in 
      detail. Its just vocabulary.

Understanding, Frameworks, and the Weird Parts:
    - JS is abstracting you away from how the 
      computer or browser or server works. We 
      need to understand how the tool is working.
    - We are going beyond the basics. It will be 
      useful to build robust and good JS apps. 
    - Frameworks like angular, jquery, react 
      and others just use JS under the hood. 
      So learn it and look at the source Code
      to understand. 
    - JS is very different under the hood from 
      mainstream programming langauges. Even though
      it may look similar. We are going to learn
      the hows and whys. Also JS has downsides
      and upsides. We will learn this.
