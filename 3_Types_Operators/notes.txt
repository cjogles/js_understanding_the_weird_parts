Types and Operators
    - JS is special and different when it comes to 
      the types of data that variables hold and how 
      JS deals with them. 
    - DYNAMIC TYPING means that the programmer doesn't 
      tell the engine what type of data a variable 
      holds, it figures it out when the code is running
      Variables can hold different types of values because
      its all figured out during execution. 
    - C# or Java uses STATIC TYPING. The programmer
      would use a keyword like "bool" to show i 
      want a boolean type, and if you set that variable
      to a string you'll get an error. JS is 
      DYNAMICALLY TYPED so you get no errors when you 
      change the type. It's dynamic. You can define 
      a variable and assign it a string value, then 
      a bool then a number and its fine. 
    - this is powerful and can also cause problems 
      if you don't understand. 

Primitive Types
    - Although we don't set variable types directly, 
      there are 6 primitive types in JS. 
    - a primitive type is a type of data that represents
      a single value. (i.e. not an object or name/value pair)
      1. Undefined (represents lack of existence)
      2. Null (represents lack of existence) better to use
         when the programmer wants to set it up themselves. 
      3. Boolean (true or false)
      4. Number (floating point number only. can make math wierd)
      5. String (sequence of chars)
      6. Symbol (used in ES6, being constructed. wont talke about this here)


Operators
    - special functions that is syntactically written
      differently. generally take two params and return 
      one result.
