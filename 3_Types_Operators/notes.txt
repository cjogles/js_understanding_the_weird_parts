Types and Operators
    - JS is special and different when it comes to 
      the types of data that variables hold and how 
      JS deals with them. 
    - DYNAMIC TYPING means that the programmer doesn't 
      tell the engine what type of data a variable 
      holds, it figures it out when the code is running
      Variables can hold different types of values because
      its all figured out during execution. 
    - C# or Java uses STATIC TYPING. The programmer
      would use a keyword like "bool" to show i 
      want a boolean type, and if you set that variable
      to a string you'll get an error. JS is 
      DYNAMICALLY TYPED so you get no errors when you 
      change the type. It's dynamic. You can define 
      a variable and assign it a string value, then 
      a bool then a number and its fine. 
    - this is powerful and can also cause problems 
      if you don't understand.
